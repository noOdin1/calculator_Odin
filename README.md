Previous implementation of the calculator was driven by the problem statement being
read from the top and implementing the solution. This made the me sought solution that
mimics the flow of how the problem is being described. After facing some roadblock and
rethinking the possible solution, I have decided to reimplement the solution using
objects in Javascript.
The older codes will be saved in to 2 separate files,
script1.js
script2.js
The 2 files were the 2 separate solutions that I thought of as a solution to the
calculator problem.
